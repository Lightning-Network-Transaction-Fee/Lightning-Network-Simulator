# Lightning-Network-Simulator

## Simulator Perspective

1. real-world, up-to-date data of Lightning Network topology (and flow)

2. useful for members of Lightning Network :
		2.0 set fee, run simulation, estimate the income
		2.1 try out new connections, run simulation, estimate the income
		2.2 find and try rebalancing options, run simulation, see whether it is a good decision or not
		2.3 Multi-Channel : try out different balance distribution between channels, find out which one is the best

3. useful for researchers
