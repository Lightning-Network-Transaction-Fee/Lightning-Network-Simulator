## Simulator Perspective

1. real-world, up-to-date data of Lightning Network topology (and flow)

2. useful for members of Lightning Network : </br>
	2.0 set fee, run simulation, estimate the income </br>
	2.1 try out new connections, run simulation, estimate the income </br>
	2.2 find and try rebalancing options, run simulation, see whether it is a good decision or not </br>
	2.3 Multi-Channel : try out different balance distribution between channels, find out which one is the best </br>

3. useful for researchers
